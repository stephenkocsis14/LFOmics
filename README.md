## Introduction

Multiomic data integration is a crucial step in understanding complex biological systems. LFOmics leverages the power of autoencoders to extract latent features from multiomic datasets, providing a unified view of the data. The extracted features are then subjected to functional enrichment analysis using GSEApy enrichr to identify significantly enriched pathways and biological processes.

## Background

## Features

- **Autoencoder-Based Latent Feature Extraction:** Efficiently extracts hidden non-linear patterns from multiomic data using a simple neural network.
