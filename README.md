## Introduction

Multiomic data integration is a crucial step in understanding complex biological systems. LFOmics leverages the power of autoencoders to extract latent features from multiomic datasets, providing a unified view of the data. The extracted features are then subjected to functional enrichment analysis using GSEApy enrichr to identify significantly enriched pathways and biological processes.

## Features

- **Autoencoder-Based Latent Feature Extraction:** Efficiently extracts hidden patterns from multiomic data.
- **GSEApy enrichr Functional Enrichment Analysis:** Performs functional enrichment analysis on top latent features to identify key biological pathways.
- **Interactive Web Interface:** User-friendly web interface for data upload, analysis configuration, and results visualization.
- **Support for Multiple Omic Types:** Handles diverse types of omic data, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and more.
- **Comprehensive Visualization:** Provides detailed visualizations of latent features and enrichment results.
